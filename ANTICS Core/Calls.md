####APPEAR
    Target under the effect of FADE or VANISH becomes visble. This call should always be vocalised, as it serves to alert players to the sudden change.
####BLIND
    Target shuts their eyes. They may not call melee damage or use any abilities which require line of sight while blinded.
####BREAK
    Modified by an item of equipment on the targetâ€™s person (e.g. â€˜John BREAK that swordâ€™), that item is disabled and cannot be used for any purpose.
####BURN
    Modified by a number. Immediately take ONE, and take another ONE every 5 seconds until you've taken a total of (that number). Can be ended early by spending about 5 seconds doing nothing other than rolling on the floor, dousing yourself with water or similar, or dropping everything you're holding and patting yourself down. Not necessarily caused by fire.
####COMMAND
    Modified by an instruction, the target must perform the instruction to the best of their ability. This is distinct from NARRATE in that COMMAND can be NIXed, NOTED and so forth, and indicates an instruction to the character, whereas NARRATE instructions are always to the player.
####DEFEAT
    Target is 'killed', regardless of hits remaining. No amount of HEALing can remove this condition. Unlike SLAY, this indicates a narrative defeat which will eventually be recovered from.
####DROP
    Modified by an item of equipment on the targetâ€™s person (e.g. â€˜DROP that gunâ€™), that piece of equipment must be dropped. If the prop is fragile it may instead be placed on the ground. If no duration is specified, they may immediately retrieve the item.
####EMOTE
    Modified by a feeling, the target must roleplay that feeling to the best of their ability (e.g. â€˜EMOTE Rageâ€™, â€˜EMOTE Agreementâ€™). EMOTE functions similarly to COMMAND, but gives the targetted player much greater discretion as to how the effect is portrayed.
####FADE
    Target disappears from view. They are affected by calls as normal, and can be detected indirectly (e.g. by SCANs, their voice, their contact with other players and objects, etc).
####FREEZE
    Target cannot move any part of their body, plus MUTE with equal duration.
####HEAL
    Target regains a specified number of hits (e.g. â€˜HEAL 2â€™). It does not allow you to regain hits over your maximum- temporary hits gained from a SHIELD are not counted towards this.
####IMMUNE
    Modified by a quality, target is completely unaffected by effects with that quality (e.g. â€˜IMMUNE to STUNâ€™, â€˜IMMUNE to Sueâ€™, â€˜IMMUNE to melee damageâ€™) and responds to them with â€˜FAILED-(Quality they're IMMUNE to)â€™. When you become IMMUNE to a quality, all ongoing effects on you with that quality are NIXed.
####MAIM
    Modified by a limb (e.g. â€˜MAIM right legâ€™), target cannot use that limb. If a leg is specified, target cannot put pressure on it. If both legs are so affected, the target must fall over. If an arm is specified, nothing can be held in or manipulated by the hand. You donâ€™t have to specify a limb if itâ€™s the one you just hit them on.
####MUTE
    Target may not speak or use their voice, except to make calls and respond to them.
####NIX
    Used in response to another call, cancels a call just made (e.g. â€˜NIX that TRIPâ€™). The original caller is still considered to have been made for the purposes of recharging and limits, but it has no effect. Used on a player or equipment affected by a call in progress prematurely ends the effects of that call (e.g. â€˜NIX your STUNâ€™). Note that this does not undo effects which have already occurred, such as damage.
####PULL
    Target may not move away from the caller. If modified by a speed (e.g. â€˜Tim PULL Jogâ€™), target must approach the caller at that speed or greater. Caller may approach and retreat from the target.
####PUSH
    Target may not approach the caller. If modified by a speed (e.g. â€˜Tim PUSH Jogâ€™), target must move away from the caller at that speed or greater. Caller may approach and retreat from the target. If affected by a PUSH and a PULL simultaneously in a way which leaves you unclear on which way to move, perform only the effect with the highest speed. If both have the same speed, stand still.
####ROOT
    Targetâ€™s feet must stay in contact with the ground in their current position. While ROOTed, you respond â€˜FAILEDâ€™ to other effects which would change your position.
####SCAN
    The target responds â€˜Hereâ€™, â€˜Pingâ€™, or otherwise identified themselves. Can be modified with an item (e.g. â€˜SCAN gunsâ€™) or quality (e.g. â€˜SCAN red teamâ€™) , in which case only players who are near the specified item or possess the specified quality should respond. Note that not all SCAN calls use MASS- if Nathan hears â€˜Nathan SCAN Metalâ€™, he responds â€˜Hereâ€™ if there is any metal in his possession.
####SHIELD
    As HEAL, except the hits gained are temporary and may cause you to exceed your maximum hits. These hits are lost before any 'full' hits. If modified by a time, any such hits still remaining are lost at the end of that time.
####SKEW
    Target must use their left hand for every action which would typically use their right hand, and vice-versa. This is an OC effect, and is not apparent to characters IC. In the case of simultaneous MAIMing and SKEWing, players should consistently interpret it in the way which is most detrimental to their character. 
####SLAY
    Target is killed, regardless of hits remaining. No amount of HEALing can restore them to life.
####SLAM
    Modified by a number, target immediately takes that many steps away from the caller, then TRIP 1.
####SLEEP
    'BLIND MUTE STUN TRIP (duration)'. If you take any damage, another character spends a few seconds attempting to rouse you, or you are searched (taking items from your hands doesn't count), END this effect.
####SLOW
    Target moves, fights, and speaks in slow motion, performing all tasks at half speed. This also affects the measurement of time for calls and abilities- treat every 2 seconds that pass while under the effect of SLOW as 1 second.
####STUN
    Target may not take any actions or move except to fall over if they wish. They should avoid observing the game progressing around them.
####TRIP
    Target falls over and cannot stand. Both feet should be off the ground at a point when the torso is on the ground, but in dirty areas players may instead drop to their knees. If no duration is specified, they may immediately stand again.
####VANISH
    Target disappears completely, raising their hand in the air and responding 'FAILED- Not Here' to all effects. If you are VANISHed by another character, see a ref. 

##MetaCalls

These are meta-calls which can be used by all players at all times where appropriate:
####NARRATE
    Players may use this at any time to describe details which would be obvious to characters, but may not be obvious to players for whatever reason (e.g.‘NARRATE The floor here is covered in soot’). This usage is similar to OC, except it conveys in-character information in a way which makes it clear it isn’t just you speaking. You should preemptively NARRATE interesting details to all players (e.g. ‘NARRATE My sword is covered in blood’). If someone NARRATEs a question to you, you must answer it immediately and truthfully (e.g. ‘NARRATE How many hits do you have?’). If someone NARRATEs an instruction to you, you must follow it to the best of your ability (e.g. ‘NARRATE You feel too weak to attack’). You can only NARRATE questions or commands if you have a skill which allows you to do so.
####OC
    Players may use this at any time to convey information relevant to other players either inside or outside of the game (eg ‘OC What does that call do?’, ‘OC I have to go in ten minutes’).
####PAUSE
    The game is temporarily halted and no actions may be taken. All players can use this call at any time with good reason. If lots of things are going on, call repeatedly, loudly and clearly until everyone has stopped what they’re doing. A ref will count the game back in once the situation has been dealt with.
####TIME FAFF
    All players who hear this should stay roughly where they are and refrain from moving forward with the plot. This is an excellent opportunity to air any grievances you may have with other characters, discuss your backstory/motivations/philosophy, double-check your plans, and go forth. This call can only be used by the organisers of the event. This lasts until the caller calls 'TIME IN'. TIME STOP
    All players who hear this immediately call ‘TIME STOP’ once, stop what they’re doing, close their eyes, and keep quiet. They should listen attentively for further instruction and description of what happens. IC, no time passes, so characters are wholly unaware of anything that happens, or even that anything is amiss (unless told otherwise). This is mainly used by refs to convey detailed narration. This lasts until the caller calls 'TIME IN'.
####WHAT DO I SEE?
    This prompts a NARRATEd response from your target about their appearance.
###Safewords

These are meta-calls which convey dis/comfort with ongoing roleplay, and can be used by all players at all times.
####RED
    Optionally modified by a quality. Immediately stop any and all roleplaying involving the quality. The caller and others involved may go 'Not Here' and walk directly out of the game, if they wish. Remember that no one can compel you to roleplay a character you don't want to play at any time. If this does occur, characters remaining IC should improvise a narration which allows the game to continue with minimal disruption.
####YELLOW
    Optionally modified by a quality. Do not escalate roleplay involving the quality beyond its current form. Roleplay can continue, but all involved should be aware that the caller is roughly at the boundary of their comfort zone.
####FRAK
    The caller is entirely comfortable with the existing roleplay, and would be comfortable with it escalating further. This is not an instruction to escalate further- the decision is yours, and you should be mindful of others around you when deciding. 'FRAK' should be considered an IC swearword in all games.
###Responses

These are meta-calls which are used in response to another call which would otherwise affect you
####DODGED
    The caller heard a call you just gave, but was noticeably unaffected by it. In order to invoke this resistance, they have had to expend some limited resource (e.g. they can only DODGE the first such call per session) or meet some non-trivial criterion (e.g. they have to physically dodge an attack).
####FAILED
    The caller heard a call you just gave, but was noticeably unaffected by it. No amount of using this same call will have an effect on the target unless something else changes. This call is typically suffixed with a short explanation of why the call didn't work (e.g. 'FAILED- Ghost', 'FAILED- Invincible')
####REFLECT
    'DODGED, [repeat exact call back at the caller]'.
####NOTED
    The caller heard a call you just gave and was affected by it in a way which isn’t obvious (e.g. they have an ability which allows them to take all STUNS as ROOTs). In this case, using the same call on the target again may be more successful, or it may not. This should also be used when it looks like you may not have heard the initial call (e.g. you are hit by ROOT when standing still and have no intention of moving anyway). Finally, this is also the preferred response if someone thinks you’ve misinterpreted a rule, but you actually have a hidden ability which takes precedence over it (e.g. you can SLAY a helpless target in one second in a game where most people require ten seconds).
