APPEAR
------
    Target under the effect of FADE or VANISH becomes visble. This call should always be vocalised, as it serves to alert players to the sudden change.
BLIND
-----
    Target shuts their eyes. They may not call melee damage or use any abilities which require line of sight while blinded.
BREAK
-----
    Modified by an item of equipment on the target’s person (e.g. ‘John BREAK that sword’), that item is disabled and cannot be used for any purpose.
BURN
----
    Modified by a number. Immediately take ONE, and take another ONE every 5 seconds until you've taken a total of (that number). Can be ended early by spending about 5 seconds doing nothing other than rolling on the floor, dousing yourself with water or similar, or dropping everything you're holding and patting yourself down. Not necessarily caused by fire.
COMMAND
-------
    Modified by an instruction, the target must perform the instruction to the best of their ability. This is distinct from NARRATE in that COMMAND can be NIXed, NOTED and so forth, and indicates an instruction to the character, whereas NARRATE instructions are always to the player.
DEFEAT
------
    Target is 'killed', regardless of hits remaining. No amount of HEALing can remove this condition. Unlike SLAY, this indicates a narrative defeat which will eventually be recovered from.
DRAIN
-----
    Prevents the use of abilities (base hits and damage calls are unaffected). Also NIXs all ongoing effects on you, and sets any personal variables to 0.
DROP
----
    Modified by an item of equipment on the target’s person (e.g. ‘DROP that gun’), that piece of equipment must be dropped. If the prop is fragile it may instead be placed on the ground. If no duration is specified, they may immediately retrieve the item.
EMOTE
-----
    Modified by a feeling, the target must roleplay that feeling to the best of their ability (e.g. ‘EMOTE Rage’, ‘EMOTE Agreement’). EMOTE functions similarly to COMMAND, but gives the targetted player much greater discretion as to how the effect is portrayed.
EMPOWER
-------
    EMOTE Energized & Confident, SHIELD 1, NIX all ongoing negative effects on you. Also sets any personal variables to their maximum values. See a ref when it's next convenient.
FADE
----
    Target disappears from view. They are affected by calls as normal, and can be detected indirectly (e.g. by SCANs, their voice, their contact with other players and objects, etc).
FREEZE
------
    Target cannot move any part of their body, plus MUTE with equal duration.
HEAL
----
    Target regains a specified number of hits (e.g. ‘HEAL 2’). It does not allow you to regain hits over your maximum- temporary hits gained from a SHIELD are not counted towards this.
IMMUNE
------
    Modified by a quality, target is completely unaffected by effects with that quality (e.g. ‘IMMUNE to STUN’, ‘IMMUNE to Sue’, ‘IMMUNE to melee damage’) and responds to them with ‘FAILED-(Quality they're IMMUNE to)’. When you become IMMUNE to a quality, all ongoing effects on you with that quality are NIXed.
MAIM
----
    Modified by a limb (e.g. ‘MAIM right leg’), target cannot use that limb. If a leg is specified, target cannot put pressure on it. If both legs are so affected, the target must fall over. If an arm is specified, nothing can be held in or manipulated by the hand. You don’t have to specify a limb if it’s the one you just hit them on.
MUTE
----
    Target may not speak or use their voice, except to make calls and respond to them.
NIX
---
    Used in response to another call, cancels a call just made (e.g. ‘NIX that TRIP’). The original caller is still considered to have been made for the purposes of recharging and limits, but it has no effect. Used on a player or equipment affected by a call in progress prematurely ends the effects of that call (e.g. ‘NIX your STUN’). Note that this does not undo effects which have already occurred, such as damage.
PULL
----
    Target may not move away from the caller. If modified by a speed (e.g. ‘Tim PULL Jog’), target must approach the caller at that speed or greater. Caller may approach and retreat from the target.
PUSH
----
    Target may not approach the caller. If modified by a speed (e.g. ‘Tim PUSH Jog’), target must move away from the caller at that speed or greater. Caller may approach and retreat from the target. If affected by a PUSH and a PULL simultaneously in a way which leaves you unclear on which way to move, perform only the effect with the highest speed. If both have the same speed, stand still.
REWIND
------
    Modified by a number. NIX all calls taken in the last (number) seconds (including damage and DEFEAT). Forget the last (number) seconds.
ROOT
----
    Target’s feet must stay in contact with the ground in their current position. While ROOTed, you respond ‘FAILED’ to other effects which would change your position.
SCAN
----
    The target responds ‘Here’, ‘Ping’, or otherwise identified themselves. Can be modified with an item (e.g. ‘SCAN guns’) or quality (e.g. ‘SCAN red team’) , in which case only players who are near the specified item or possess the specified quality should respond. Note that not all SCAN calls use MASS- if Nathan hears ‘Nathan SCAN Metal’, he responds ‘Here’ if there is any metal in his possession.
SHIELD
------
    As HEAL, except the hits gained are temporary and may cause you to exceed your maximum hits. These hits are lost before any 'full' hits. If modified by a time, any such hits still remaining are lost at the end of that time.
SKEW
----
    Target must use their left hand for every action which would typically use their right hand, and vice-versa. This is an OC effect, and is not apparent to characters IC. In the case of simultaneous MAIMing and SKEWing, players should consistently interpret it in the way which is most detrimental to their character. 
SLAY
----
    Target is killed, regardless of hits remaining. No amount of HEALing can restore them to life.
SLAM
----
    Modified by a number, target immediately takes that many steps away from the caller, then TRIP 1.
SLEEP
-----
    'BLIND MUTE STUN TRIP (duration)'. If you take any damage, another character spends a few seconds attempting to rouse you, or you are searched (taking items from your hands doesn't count), END this effect.
SLOW
----
    Target moves, fights, and speaks in slow motion, performing all tasks at half speed. This also affects the measurement of time for calls and abilities- treat every 2 seconds that pass while under the effect of SLOW as 1 second.
STUN
----
    Target may not take any actions or move except to fall over if they wish. They should avoid observing the game progressing around them.
TRIP
----
    Target falls over and cannot stand. Both feet should be off the ground at a point when the torso is on the ground, but in dirty areas players may instead drop to their knees. If no duration is specified, they may immediately stand again.
VANISH
------
    Target disappears completely, raising their hand in the air and responding 'FAILED- Not Here' to all effects. If you are VANISHed by another character, see a ref.
